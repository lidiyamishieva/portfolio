## 1 Introduction

In the political, public and academic debate, social cohesion is commonly regarded as a feature that always seems to be currently deteriorating. The origins of the concept of social cohesion can be traced back to classical sociological research, which sought to understand the 'social glue' holding modern societies together [@durkheim2018; @ferdinand1887community]. Contemporary research on social cohesion has largely moved away from general sociological theory, but has not arrived at a universally accepted definition yet [@schiefer2016]. Policy-oriented research mainly focuses on measurement models of social cohesion, where social cohesion is typically defined as a latent, not directly measurable, property of populations [@chan2006a], consisting of multiple dimensions (@jenson1998mapping; @duhaime2004; @berger-schmitt; @noll2002; @rajulton2006; @bollen1990; @whelan2005; @chan2006a).

@bottoni2016 proposes and validates a latent multi-level model of social cohesion as a synthesis of multiple contributions in the literature. Their model distinguishes between the collective and individual dimension of the phenomenon, where social cohesion is treated as a collective property of a population, whereas social inclusion is conceptualized as an individual-level attribute. Dimensions of social cohesion used in Bottoni's model are relational in nature, capturing both practical interactions between individuals (*social support*, *participation*, *density of relations*) and attitudinal dispositions towards individuals, institutions or groups (*interpersonal* and *institutional trust*, *openness towards out-groups*, *legitimacy of institutions*).

Designing targeted policies to strengthen social cohesion requires evidence on how cohesion varies across sub-national areas. While some dimensions, such as trust, civic participation, and attitudes toward immigration, have been shown to vary spatially within countries [@van2025multilevel]; @moretti2024; @czaika2018; @orteca2015investigation\], systematic evidence on the small-scale spatial distribution of social cohesion across Europe remains limited.

Being measured at individual level, social cohesion indicators need to be aggregated to regional level. However, survey data is typically not designed for obtaining efficient estimates at a sub-national level. Small area estimation (SAE) offers a methodological tool capable of producing more accurate and precise estimates using survey data. SAE consists of estimating target parameters for groups or 'areas' where the sample size is small or which do not appear in the sampling design using statistical models. This is done by ‘borrowing strength’ via incorporating auxiliary information correlated with target estimates [@rao2015]. Compared to direct estimates, SAE typically lowers the mean squared error by leveraging the bias-variance trade-off. For social cohesion, multivariate SAE [@benavent2016] could help making use of the relatedness of different social cohesion dimensions and improve the estimated even further.

Geographic big data can potentially help explaining spatial variability in outcomes modeled through small area estimation by offering high-resolution geo-referenced data of built and natural environment. OpenStreetMap (OSM) represents one of the most prominent of these sources [@goodchild2013]. Although some studies highlight its potential for official statistics [@salvucci2021, @ninivaggi2023; @balducci2019], its use as auxiliary information in SAE remains unexplored. OSM’s data quality and completeness have been subject of extensive investigation. In terms of coverage, regions with higher building density are better covered, meaning that urban areas better represented in OSM [@zhou2017]. But there are differences: urban areas which are located in Europe, are economically better off and more urbanized have the highest building completeness [@herfort2023]. While street network is well covered across the globe [@barrington-leigh2017] feature-dependent completeness for buildings was evaluated only in some local studies [@balducci2019; @maina2019].

Against this background, the question arises: To what extent can small area estimates of social cohesion at the sub-national level in Europe be improved by the use of new data sources? This thesis is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on the immediate residential environment as a determinant of social cohesion, with the aim of identifying suitable covariates for the small-area estimation models that can be derived from OSM. Section 3 provides an overview of the data sources and variables used in the analysis. Section 4 then describes the methodological approach.

## 2 Theoretical background

*Relations between individuals*

Spatial composition and spatial configuration are characteristics of physical space, shaping the conditions under which social interaction between individuals becomes more or less likely [@small2019]. Spatial composition refers to the physical elements that constitute a space and can serve as locations for social interaction. However, not all places contribute equally to social relations. Places serving as intentional gathering places can act as foci around which people organize their interactions and thereby will form interpersonal ties and clusters of social connections [@feld1981]. By contrast, spaces that bring people together only through mere co-presence, without supporting shared activities or a sense of collective identity, may have limited impact on building social cohesion among residents [@wickes2018].

Spatial configuration refers to the arrangement of land use and the segmentation of physical space by man-made or natural boundaries, which can act as barriers to social interaction [@small2019]. The extent to which its layout allows social ties to move easily across space can impose constraints on how social relations are built and maintained within this space [@hipp2014]. Low-density, single-use layouts in residential environments reduce perceived safety for pedestrians and cyclists and can discourage movement [@cho2009]. Individuals perceive walking in parks as safer and more attractive than walking through residential areas [@basu2022]. In addition, some spatial features can have ambivalent effects: retail destinations may attract outsiders whom local residents interpret as a potential threat to safety [@foster2013].

*Relations between individuals and groups*

Social infrastructure – spaces such as libraries, parks, educational institutions, and community centers – is commonly understood as infrastructure that serves as networking space thereby facilitating inter-personal trust [@joshi2022]. These interactions can also facilitate positive relations between different social groups [@christie1954]. Areas with greater availability of social infrastructure expose residents to a broader range of potentially heterogeneous social contacts [@heine2025; @fraser2024]. Persistent inequalities in access to amenities driven by social segregation across space [@michelangeli2025] may limit the potential for cross-group encounters. Further, social segregation is reproduced within certain types of social infrastructure by reinforcing interactions among similar groups rather than fostering diversity [@fraser2024a].

*Relations between individuals and institutions*

The quality of local infrastructure shapes how individuals evaluate and relate to public institutions. When residents feel satisfied with the amenities and services in their residential area, they tend to express higher trust in local authorities, which can serve as a foundation to general public trust [@fitzgerald2014]. At the same time, perceptions of deteriorating or unequal service provision can erode institutional trust, as seen in widening urban–rural divides where rural residents increasingly view their socio-economic infrastructure as lagging behind that of urban centers [@mckay2023; @mitsch2021]. Dissatisfaction with local amenities can prompt people to move elsewhere [@dustmann2014; @ulrich-schad2015], suggesting that institutional performance additionally indirectly shapes trust by influencing residential stability and the ability to sustain long-term community ties.

## 3 Data

### 3.1 Survey data

For measuring social cohesion, the operationalization is based on the latent model proposed by @bottoni2016. The model was originally validated using indicators from the European Social Survey (ESS) Round 6 (2012). The ESS is a biennial, cross-national survey based ont cross-sectional probability sampling of all persons aged 15 years and older residing in private households within each participating country. In ESS, the data is geo-referenced through Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) regions. The available levels of aggregation of geographic location is different across European countries as illustrated in @tbl-nuts.

Bottoni’s original framework includes seven dimensions of social cohesion, but this thesis models only five due to data limitations in ESS Round 11 (2023). The dimensions of social support and participation are excluded because the corresponding indicators are unavailable. Using earlier ESS rounds would allow their inclusion but would require outdated and incomplete OSM data. The selected approach prioritizes consistency with current, higher-quality OSM information. The dimensions and the indicators are displayed in @tbl-variables-survey.

: ESS round 11 questions measuring five dimensions of social cohesion {#tbl-variables-survey}

### 3.2 Auxiliary data

#### 3.2.1 Adminstrative data

For administrative data, we use statistics from Eurostat for EU countries and from NOMIS for the UK. These sources provide reliable and comparable administrative data for NUTS-regions. The variables included in the analysis are population density, GDP per capita, employment, and number of police-recorded offences.

#### 3.2.2 OpenStreetMap data

OSM data can be accessed via the read-only application programming interface Overpass API using the Overpass Query Language (Overpass QL), which supports filtering by attributes, geometry, and geographic extent. The database is structured around three core elements: nodes (point coordinates), ways (ordered lists of nodes forming lines or areas), and relations (groupings of nodes and ways). Attributes in OSM are described using tags, which are flexible key–value pairs attached to nodes, ways, and relations.

An OSM snapshot dated 01.01.2023 was used to match ESS11, with queries limited to the administrative boundaries of ESS11 countries that use NUTS classification for official statistics. All attributes documented for each feature were extracted. The key-value pairs used in the queries are listed in @tbl-variables-osm. The choice of the features is based on the literature review introduced in Chapter 2.

## 4 Methods

The analysis proceeds in two main steps. First, a multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA) model is estimated according to the specification in @tbl-variables-survey, using NUTS region as cluster variable. Factor scores are then computed at the regional level for each factor at regional level. These scores provide aggregate measures of social cohesion and serve as direct estimators in the second step. In this step, multivariate small-area models are estimated in three variants: (M1) without any auxiliary data, (M2) with administrative data, and (M3) with administrative and OSM data. All small area estimates are validated against figures reported in the existing literature, and improvements in estimator efficiency are assessed by comparing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) across the models.

### 4.1 Multilevel Confirmatory Factor Analysis

The two-level MCFA model can be defined in terms of its within- and between-level components. At the within-level, the model is:

\begin{equation}
y_{ijk} = \alpha_{jk} + \lambda_{Wk} \eta_{Wij} + \epsilon_{Wijk},
\end{equation}

where $y_{ijk}$ denotes the observed value of respondent $i = 1, ..., I$ in region $j=1,...,J$ on indicator $k=1,...,K$. Here, $\alpha_{jk}$ is the intercept of indicator $k$ in region $j$, $\lambda_{Wk}$ is the within-level factor loading $\lambda_{W}$ of indicator variable $k$. $\eta_{Wij}$ is the score of the respondent $i$ in region $j$ on the within-level latent factor, and $\epsilon_{Wijk}$ is the within-level residual. At the between-level, the model is specified as:

\begin{equation}
\alpha_{jk} = \nu_{k} + \lambda_{Bk} \eta_{Bj} + \epsilon_{Bjk},
\end{equation}

where $\nu_{k}$ denotes the grand (cross-region) intercept of indicator $k$, $\lambda_{Bk}$ is the between-level factor loading of indicator variable $k$, $\eta_{Bj}$ is the score of region $j$ on the between-level latent factor, and $\epsilon_{Bjk}$ is the between-level error term, also referred to as random intercept in multilevel analysis. The within and between components of the model are connected via the intercept $a_{jk}$, which acts as a latent random variable. Its variability is explained by the between-level factor $\eta_{Bj}$, while any remaining variance is captured by the between–level residual $\epsilon_{Bjk}$.

In matrix notation, MCFA can be expressed through its variance structure. The total covariance matrix of the observed indicators is decomposed into within- and between-level components:

\begin{align}
V(y_{gi}) &= \Sigma_{B} + \Sigma_{W}, \\
\Sigma_{B} &= \Lambda_{B} \Psi_{B} \Lambda_{B}^{T} + \Theta_{B}, \\
\Sigma_{W} &= \Lambda_{W} \Psi_{W} \Lambda_{W}^{T} + \Theta_{W},
\end{align}

where $\Sigma_{W}$ and $\Sigma_{B}$ are the modeled covariance matrices, $\Lambda_{W}$ and $\Lambda_{B}$ are the matrices of factor loadings, $\Psi_{W}$ and $\Psi_{B}$ are the factor covariance matrices, while $\Theta_W$ and $\Theta_{B}$ the covariance matrices of the residuals.

For the present model, all indicators are treated as continuous and residual covariance matrices $\Theta$ are estimated directly from the data.

*Estimation of factor scores*

Once a measurement model is determined, factor scores can be computed for both within- and between-level latent factors. For within-level factors with continuous indicators, factor scores can be estimated using the regression method (@thomson1935; @thurstone1935), which corresponds to the posterior mean of the latent factor given the observed data. The factor scores for an individual $i$ are given by:

\begin{equation}
\hat{F}_{\eta_{i}} = \hat{\Psi} \hat{\Lambda}^{T} (\Sigma(\hat{\Theta}))^{-1} y_{i}^{T},
\end{equation}

where $\hat{\Lambda}$ is the estimated matrix of factor loadings, $\hat{\Psi}$ is the estimated covariance matrix of latent factors, $\Sigma(\hat{\Theta})$ is the estimated covariance matrix of the residuals of observed responses, and $y_{i}$​ is the vector of observed responses for individual $i$.

In MCFA, cluster-level indicators correspond to random intercepts, which are latent variables themselves. Between-level factor scores can be estimated using empirical Bayes methods in combination with full-information ML estimation, with posterior means computed conditional on the model and observed data (@asparouhov2015). The estimation of the model and the factor scores is performed in *Mplus*, Version 8.11.

### 4.2 Small Area Estimation approach

Consider a finite population $U$ with size $N$ divided into $D$ small areas (domains) with indexes $d=1,...,D$ and size $N_d$. The sample size $n$ is the sum $\Sigma_{d} n_{d}$ of small area sample sizes $n_{d}$. Let $y_{d} = (y_{d1},...,y_{dK})^T$ denote a vector of direct survey estimators for $Y_{d}$ based on a random sample $s$ of size $n$ selected from the population $U$. $Y_{d}$ denotes the population mean of $K$ characteristics of interest in small area $d$.

The univariate @fay1979 model, with $K=1$, is defined in two stages. The first stage consists of the sampling model:

\begin{equation}
y_{d} = Y_{d} + e_{d}, e_{d} ∼ N(0, \sigma^{2}_{d}),
\end{equation}

where $e_{d}$ represents the sampling error, assumed to be independent across and within small areas, with known variance $\sigma^{2}_{d}$. The sampling model accounts for the sampling variability of the direct estimators $y_{d}$, whereas in the second stage, the population means, $Y_d$ are linked to the auxiliary variables via the linking model:

\begin{equation}
Y_{d} = X_{d}\beta + u_{d}, u_{d} ∼ N(0, \sigma^{2}_{u}),
\end{equation}

where $X_{d} = diag(x_{d1}, ..., x_{dK})_{K \times p}$ is a matrix of auxiliary variables for small area $d$, $\beta = (\beta_{1}^{T}, ... , \beta_{K}^{T})^{T}_{p \times 1}$ is a vector of fixed effect coefficients, and $u_{d}$ is a random effect capturing unexplained variability across small areas. The univariate model is extended to the multivariate model by allowing multiple characteristics $K$ per small area $d$. In a multivarite model, sampling errors $e_{d} ∼ N(0, V_{e_{d}})$ are independent across small areas with known $K \times K$ covariance matrices $V_{e_{d}}$ and the $K \times K$ covariance matrix $V_{u_{d}}$ of random effects depends on $m$ unknown parameters $\Theta = (\theta_{1}, ..., \theta_{m})$. The multi-variate Fay-Herriot model proposed by @benavent2016 is thus defined as:

\begin{equation}
y_{d} =  X_{d}\beta + u_{d} + e_{d}, \\ 
e_{d} ∼ N(0, V_{e_{d}}), u_{d} ∼ N(0, V_{u_{d}}), d = 1,...,D. 
\end{equation}

In matrix form, the multivariate Fay-Herriot model is:

\begin{equation}
y = X\beta + Zu + e,
\end{equation}

where $y$ is a $DK \times 1$ vector of direct estimates, $X$ is a $DK \times p$ matrix of auxiliary variables, $Z$ is a $DK \times DK$ diagonal matrix, whose $d^{th}$ column is an indicator taking the value 1 if the unit belongs to area $d$ and 0 otherwise. Furthermore, $u$ denotes a $DK \times 1$ vector of random effects for area $d$ and $e$ is a $DK \times 1$ vector of sampling errors. The Multivariate Empirical Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (MEBLUP) of $Y$ by the use of Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) method is given by:

\begin{equation}
\hat{Y}^{MEBLUP} = X\hat{\beta} + Z\hat{u},
\end{equation}

$\hat{\beta}$ being the estimator of $\beta$, and $\hat{u}$ the estimator of $u$. MSE is estimated as a measure of uncertainty of the $\hat{Y}^{MEBLUP}$ using the method proposed by @benavent2016.

In this thesis, small areas are defined as NUTS-3 regions. Although the model is specified at the NUTS-3 level, for countries where NUTS-3 regions are not available, values are taken from the highest available level (NUTS-2 or NUTS-1) and are assumed to be homogeneous across all NUTS-3 regions within that higher-level unit. Small area estimates for NUTS-3 regions in these countries will rely entirely on auxiliary data.

The small area model and MSE are both estimated using the R package *msae*, Version 0.1.5.
